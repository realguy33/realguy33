i am a freelance Data Analyst mainly interested in the web3 space. I have recently finished my B.Sc degree(subjects-Mathematics and Statistics) and I am also half way through a flexible part-time B.S. degree in data science from IIT Madras. 

I mainly use Flipside(SQL) and subgraphs(python and GraphQL) for my analysis work. I have started analysing Farcaster as well and i will try to do my best to upload the codes here. 

I am very fascinated by both blockchain and AI technologies so i try my best to research about these technologies and learn as much as i can.
